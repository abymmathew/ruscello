a TypeScript Flux implementation

### Usage:
```bash
npm install && npm start
```

## About
I kept this very minimalistic on purpose. Feel free to fork or clone and hack.

Uses cheerio to scrape NYT Best Sellers list and ship it to UI.

Under the hood it is using [facebook's flux](https://github.com/facebook/flux) with
the corresponding [type definitions](https://github.com/borisyankov/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/flux).

Also, I am using [typed-react](https://github.com/Asana/typed-react) to help implement React components
in TypeScript.
